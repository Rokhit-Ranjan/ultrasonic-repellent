Ultrasonic Repellent 

Components used :
                ->Ardiuno UNO R3
                ->IR Sensor
                ->8ohm Speaker
                ->Jumper Wires

Problem Statement:
              The field of agriculture lands are destroyed by the animals like elephants and pigs 

solution:
      The fiels can saved by producing ultrasonic sound in the fields so the animals are irrtated for the sound and runs away from the field thats how the fields are saved using this project

          ->connect the speaker to ardiuno I/O pin9
          ->connect the vcc to vcc
          ->connect the GND to GND
          upload the code and run the program
